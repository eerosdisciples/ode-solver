# ode-solver
A tool for simulating charged particle orbits in fusion plasmas.

This tool was developed as part of the Bachelor project TIFX02-15-41 at the department for Applied Physics, Chalmers University of Technology (2015).

## Description
When designing a fusion device, knowledge of particle motion with the device is necessary. The aim of this project has been to develop a simulation tool capable of calculating orbits for different kinds of particles, and then to analyze the orbits and explain them.

The simulation tool utilizes two different methods for simulation: regular particle motion (derived directly from the Lorentz force), and the guiding-center method. These methods have also been compared in the thesis with regard to performance and agreement, and as expected it turns out that the guiding-center method is far superior in both of these.
